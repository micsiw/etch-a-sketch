My next exercise in The Odin Project. I will create interpretation of Etch a Sketch toy using HTML, CSS and JS.

This tool is pretty simple, just hover mouse over the grid to start drawing.

Grid is customizable from sizes 10x10 up to 70x70.

To make this more amicable, user can choose additional modes to make things more interesting.

- Rainbow mode - instead of dull grey color, random color will appear from bright colors palette,
- Shading mode - hovering mouse now will add some black color to actual one, creating shading effect,
- Erase mode - hovering mouse will just clean the grid,
- Reset - start again

Tool was created by using vanilla JS and CSS. A lot of DOM manipulation with adding multiple classes to control the content.

It was created as assignment for The Odin Project - open source coding curriculum for learning web development.
